These include, but are not limited to, reimbursement, drug interactions, dispensing of medicines, side effects, digital prescriptions, identification of health professionals, healthcare resource management, and the prescription of medicines and medical devices.

Additional information: The elements within the Health Legislation on Governance Interoperability (NBI) catalogue are designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the various aspects of healthcare that are governed by national legislation. These elements cover a wide range of topics, from the reimbursement of private laboratory tests to the identification of health professionals and their qualifications. Each element is represented by a national schema or legal act, providing a structured and standardized approach to healthcare governance. This catalogue is crucial for ensuring interoperability in healthcare, facilitating the exchange of information and coordination between different healthcare systems and providers.

Example: For instance, the 'National Schema on reimbursement' would provide a standardized approach to how healthcare services are reimbursed in a particular country. Similarly, the 'National Schema on drugs interactions' would provide a comprehensive overview of how different drugs interact with each other, which is crucial for ensuring patient safety. The 'National legal act establishing trust models for the identification of health professionals and their habilitations' would provide a legal framework for verifying the identities and qualifications of health professionals, ensuring that patients receive care from qualified individuals.
