This profile complements XDS by describing a mechanism whereby an XDS Affinity Domain can develop and implement multiple privacy policies, and describes how that mechanism can be integrated with the access control mechanisms supported by the XDS Actors (e.g. EHR systems).

Additional information: The Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) Basic Patient Privacy Consents (BPPC) specification is a healthcare information technology standard that provides a framework for managing patient privacy consents. This specification is designed to ensure that healthcare organizations can effectively manage and enforce patient privacy consents, which are legal agreements that specify what personal health information can be shared, with whom, and for what purposes.

The BPPC specification defines a standardized way to record, exchange, and enforce these consents across different healthcare IT systems. It provides a common language and structure for representing privacy consents, making it easier for different systems to understand and respect each patient's privacy preferences.

The BPPC specification is part of the IHE's broader effort to improve the interoperability of healthcare IT systems. By standardizing the way privacy consents are managed, the BPPC specification helps to ensure that patient privacy is protected, regardless of which systems are used to store or share their information.

The BPPC specification includes several key components:

1. Consent Document: This is a legal document that records the patient's privacy preferences. The BPPC specification provides a standardized format for this document, making it easier for different systems to understand and enforce the patient's preferences.

2. Consent Enforcement: The BPPC specification defines how healthcare IT systems should enforce the patient's privacy preferences. This includes checking the patient's consent document before sharing their information, and blocking any sharing that the patient has not consented to.

3. Consent Exchange: The BPPC specification also defines how consent documents should be exchanged between different healthcare IT systems. This ensures that all systems have access to the most up-to-date consent information, and can therefore accurately enforce the patient's privacy preferences.

In summary, the IHE BPPC specification provides a standardized way to manage patient privacy consents in healthcare IT systems. This helps to protect patient privacy and improve the interoperability of these systems.

Example: 1. Electronic Health Records (EHR) Systems: EHR systems can apply IHE BPPC to manage and enforce patient privacy consents. For example, a patient may give consent for their primary care physician to access their full medical records, but only allow a specialist to access information relevant to their specialty. The EHR system can use BPPC to enforce these consents, ensuring that each healthcare provider only has access to the information they are allowed to see.

2. Telemedicine Platforms: Telemedicine platforms can use IHE BPPC to manage patient privacy consents for virtual consultations. For instance, a patient may consent to a video consultation with their doctor, but not want their data to be stored or shared with other healthcare providers. The telemedicine platform can use BPPC to enforce these consents, ensuring that the patient's privacy is respected.

3. Health Information Exchanges (HIE): HIEs can apply IHE BPPC to manage the sharing of patient information between different healthcare providers. For example, a patient may consent to their information being shared with their primary care physician and a specialist, but not with other healthcare providers. The HIE can use BPPC to enforce these consents, ensuring that the patient's information is only shared with the approved providers.

4. Clinical Research Studies: Clinical research studies can use IHE BPPC to manage patient privacy consents for the use of their data in research. For example, a patient may consent to their data being used for a specific study, but not for other studies or for commercial purposes. The research study can use BPPC to enforce these consents, ensuring that the patient's data is only used in the approved manner.

5. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Compliance: Healthcare providers can use IHE BPPC to help ensure they are in compliance with HIPAA regulations regarding patient privacy. By using BPPC to manage and enforce patient privacy consents, healthcare providers can demonstrate that they are taking the necessary steps to protect patient information and respect their privacy rights.
