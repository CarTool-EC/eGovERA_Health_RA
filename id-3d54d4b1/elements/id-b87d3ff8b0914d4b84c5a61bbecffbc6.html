Additional information: The Chronic Care Management System (CCMS) is a critical tool in modern healthcare, particularly for patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. The system is designed to streamline the management of patient care, reducing the burden on healthcare providers and improving patient outcomes. It includes features such as electronic health records, patient portals, telehealth capabilities, and data analytics tools. The system also facilitates the sharing of health information between different healthcare providers, ensuring that all members of a patient's care team have access to the same information. Additionally, the CCMS provides resources for patient self-management, empowering patients to take an active role in their own healthcare.

Example: A patient with diabetes and heart disease can use the CCMS to track their health data, schedule appointments with their healthcare providers, and access resources to help them manage their conditions.
A healthcare provider can use the CCMS to monitor a patient's health data, communicate with other members of the patient's care team, and provide the patient with resources for self-management.
