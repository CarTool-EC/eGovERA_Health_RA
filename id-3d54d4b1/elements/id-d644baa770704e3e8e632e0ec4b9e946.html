Additional information: The Health Digital Business Capabilities Map ABB is a comprehensive catalogue of digital capabilities in the healthcare sector. It is designed to provide a clear and structured overview of the various digital capabilities that are essential in the modern healthcare industry. These capabilities are crucial in improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of healthcare services. They enable healthcare providers to leverage digital technologies to enhance their services, improve patient outcomes, and streamline their operations.

Example: For instance, the 'Consultation' capability refers to the ability to digitally support a medical consultation, including processes and activities related to digital consultations directly asked/booked by people to a healthcare provider. Another example is the 'Crisis and threat management' capability, which supports the rapid response and effective information communication to the public and to health professionals during a health crisis or a long-term threat.
