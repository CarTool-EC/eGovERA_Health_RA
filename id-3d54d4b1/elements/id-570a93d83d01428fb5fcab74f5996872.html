Additional information: An EHRS is more than just a digital version of a patient's paper chart. It's a comprehensive system that allows for the collection, storage, management, and transmission of a patient's electronic health information. This includes everything from demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data, and radiology reports. The EHRS has the ability to provide clinical decision support, clinical alerts, reminders, and medical information. It can also interface with other healthcare providers, such as laboratories and radiologists. Therefore, it's a critical tool for improving the quality, safety, and efficiency of healthcare delivery.

Example: A primary care physician can use EHRS to track a patient's health over time, monitor changes in vital signs, and adjust treatment plans accordingly. The system can also alert the physician to potential issues, such as interactions between different medications the patient is taking.

Hospitals can use EHRS to streamline the admission, discharge, and transfer process. By having all of a patient's information in one place, healthcare providers can make more informed decisions about care and reduce the chance of medical errors.

Public health officials can use aggregated data from EHRS to monitor health trends, track disease outbreaks, and conduct research.
