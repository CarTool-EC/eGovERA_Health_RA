Additional information: Health remote sensing and continuous monitoring is a rapidly growing field in digital health, driven by advancements in wearable technology, IoT devices, and AI. It involves the use of sensors and devices to collect and analyze health data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels, sleep patterns, and physical activity. The data is then transmitted to healthcare providers in real-time, allowing for continuous monitoring of patients' health status. This service is particularly useful for managing chronic diseases, elderly care, post-surgery monitoring, and telemedicine. It not only improves patient care but also reduces healthcare costs by preventing hospital readmissions and enabling proactive health management.

Example: A patient with diabetes uses a wearable device that continuously monitors their glucose levels and sends the data to their healthcare provider. The provider can then adjust the patient's treatment plan based on the data received.
An elderly person living alone wears a device that monitors their heart rate and physical activity. If the device detects any abnormality, it immediately alerts the healthcare provider and the person's family.
A patient recovering from surgery wears a device that monitors their vital signs and wound healing progress. The data is sent to the healthcare provider, allowing them to track the patient's recovery and intervene if any complications arise.
