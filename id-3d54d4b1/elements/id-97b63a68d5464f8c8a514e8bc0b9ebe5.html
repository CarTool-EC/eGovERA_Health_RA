These agreements define the governance models, guidelines, rules, and policies for various aspects of health services, including eHealth services, remote sensing practices, exchange and reuse of medical data, accreditation of private healthcare facilities, recognition of health professions, certification of laboratory practices, availability of pharmacies, cross-border exchange of health data, imaging diagnosis guidelines, transformation of primary data into secondary data, and agreements for National Contact Points for eHealth.

Additional information: The Health Organisational Agreements Catalogue ABB includes various elements, each of which represents a specific organisational agreement related to health services. These agreements are established between different entities such as public administrations, citizens, Member States, private healthcare facilities, health professionals, and laboratory facilities. They define the roles, responsibilities, and processes for various aspects of health services, ensuring the proper governance, operation, accreditation, recognition, certification, availability, exchange, use, and reuse of health services and data.

Example: For instance, the 'eHealth Network - Governance model for the eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure' is an organisational agreement between Member States defining a governance model to support the governance, establishment, and operation of National Contact Point for eHealth (NCPeH) for the provision of Cross-Border eHealth Information Services. Another example is the 'Exchange of medical data', which is an organisational agreement between public institutions regulating the share of health data defining the roles, responsibilities, and processes in place for the share of data.
