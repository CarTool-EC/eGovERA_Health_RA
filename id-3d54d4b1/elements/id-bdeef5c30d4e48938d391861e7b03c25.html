In particular, it is intended to support the European implementation of IPS by delivering a guideline.  European policy, directives, organisational and professional culture, and a diverse marketplace require implementation guidance that is technically relevant and contextually sensitive. CEN/TS 17288 describes these implementation aspects from the European perspective, using the Refined eHealth European Interoperability Framework (ReEIF) to structure the content in a way that is familiar to the European audience.

Additional information: The CEN/TS 17288, also known as The International Patient Summary (IPS), is a technical specification developed by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). It provides a guideline for the European implementation of an international patient summary. The specification aims to establish a common framework for the creation, management, exchange, and use of patient summaries across different healthcare settings and countries.

The International Patient Summary is a set of essential healthcare information intended for unexpected or unplanned care scenarios. It includes critical information such as patient demographics, health problems, medications, allergies, immunizations, past surgeries, and care plans. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with the necessary information to ensure the continuity, safety, and efficiency of care, especially in emergency situations or when the patient is abroad.

The CEN/TS 17288 specification outlines the structure and content of the IPS, as well as the technical and semantic standards for its interoperability. It defines the minimum dataset for the patient summary, the coding and terminology standards (such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, and ICD), and the use of HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for data exchange.

The specification also addresses issues related to data quality, privacy, and security. It provides guidelines for obtaining patient consent, ensuring data accuracy and completeness, protecting patient data from unauthorized access, and complying with data protection regulations.

The CEN/TS 17288 is part of a broader effort to standardize electronic health records (EHRs) and promote health data interoperability in Europe. It supports the European eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure (eHDSI), which enables the cross-border exchange of patient summaries and ePrescriptions among European countries.

Example: 1. Emergency Care: In an emergency situation, healthcare providers can use the International Patient Summary (IPS) to quickly access a patient's critical health information. This can include allergies, current medications, past surgeries, and chronic conditions. The IPS can be used to ensure that the patient receives appropriate and safe care, even if they are unable to communicate or if their regular healthcare provider is not available.

2. Cross-Border Healthcare: If a patient from one European country seeks medical care in another, the IPS can be used to share relevant health information with the foreign healthcare provider. This can ensure that the patient receives consistent care, even in a different healthcare system.

3. Telemedicine: The IPS can be used in telemedicine consultations to provide the healthcare provider with a comprehensive overview of the patient's health status. This can be particularly useful in situations where the patient and provider are not in the same location.

4. Chronic Disease Management: For patients with chronic diseases, the IPS can be used to share information between different healthcare providers involved in their care. This can ensure that all providers have a consistent understanding of the patient's condition and treatment plan.

5. Research: The IPS can be used in research to provide a standardized format for patient health data. This can facilitate large-scale studies and comparisons between different patient populations.

6. Health Information Exchange: The IPS can be used as a standard format for exchanging health information between different healthcare systems or electronic health record systems. This can facilitate interoperability and ensure that patient information is accurately and consistently represented across different systems.
