Additional information: The Health Smart Devices Enablers ABB includes the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), which refers to the collection of medical devices and applications that connect to healthcare IT systems through online computer networks. These devices, equipped with Wi-Fi, allow machine-to-machine communication, forming the basis of IoMT. The grouping also includes Reference Testing and Experimentation Facility Technology infrastructure, which encompasses technologies and devices used for medical imaging, such as radiography, MRI, CT, fluoroscopy, ultrasound, echocardiography, and nuclear medicine. These devices are used for diagnostic purposes, providing images of the body to aid in correct diagnosis and determining future care. Lastly, the grouping includes Diagnostic Medical Imaging Equipment, which refers to a technology infrastructure with specific expertise in testing mature technology in a given sector, under real or close to real conditions.

Example: An example of Health Smart Devices Enablers in action could be a hospital using IoMT devices to monitor patient vital signs in real-time, transmitting this data to a central healthcare IT system. This data could then be analyzed using advanced diagnostic medical imaging equipment, with the results informing the patient's treatment plan. Meanwhile, a Reference Testing and Experimentation Facility could be used to test and validate new medical technologies before they are deployed in a real-world healthcare setting.
