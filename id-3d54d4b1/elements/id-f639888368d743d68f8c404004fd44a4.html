Defines Detailed Clinical Models (DCMs) in terms of an underlying logical model. They are logical models of clinical concepts and can be used to define and to structure clinical information. Describes requirements and principles for DCMs, meta-data, versioning, content and context specification, data element specification and data element relationships, and provide guidance and examples. Specifies DCM governance principles to ensure conceptual integrity of all DCM attributes and logical model accuracy. Describes DCM development and the methodology principles for use that will support the production of quality DCMs to minimize risk and ensure patient safety.

Additional information: ISO/TS 13972:2015, also known as Health Informatics -- Detailed Clinical Models, Characteristics and Processes, is a technical specification developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This specification provides guidelines for the development, utilization, and governance of Detailed Clinical Models (DCMs), which are key components in the field of health informatics.

Detailed Clinical Models are structured and standardized representations of a specific clinical concept, such as a disease, treatment, or medical procedure. They are used to facilitate the exchange of clinical information between different healthcare systems, ensuring that the data remains accurate and consistent regardless of where or how it is used. 

ISO/TS 13972:2015 outlines the characteristics that a DCM should have. These include being clinically relevant, being able to be understood by both humans and machines, and being able to be used in a variety of different healthcare contexts. The specification also provides a methodology for developing DCMs, which includes steps such as identifying the clinical concept to be modeled, defining the attributes of the concept, and validating the model with clinical experts.

In addition, ISO/TS 13972:2015 provides guidelines for the governance of DCMs. This includes processes for managing changes to the models, ensuring their quality, and maintaining their interoperability with other systems. The specification also discusses the use of metadata to describe the characteristics and usage of the models.

Overall, ISO/TS 13972:2015 aims to promote the use of standardized, high-quality DCMs in health informatics. By following this specification, healthcare organizations can ensure that their clinical data is accurate, consistent, and can be easily shared and understood by both humans and machines.

Example: 1. Electronic Health Record Systems: ISO/TS 13972 can be applied in the development and implementation of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. These systems need to have detailed clinical models to accurately capture, store, and interpret patient data. The standard helps in defining the structure and semantics of the data, ensuring interoperability between different systems, and maintaining the quality and safety of the data.

2. Clinical Decision Support Systems: These systems provide clinicians with patient-specific assessments or recommendations to aid clinical decision-making. By applying ISO/TS 13972, these systems can ensure that the clinical models they use are detailed, accurate, and reliable. This can improve the quality of the recommendations and reduce the risk of errors.

3. Telemedicine Platforms: Telemedicine platforms can apply ISO/TS 13972 to ensure that the clinical data they collect and transmit is accurate, reliable, and can be easily interpreted by healthcare providers. This can improve the quality of remote care and increase patient satisfaction.

4. Health Information Exchange: Health information exchange (HIE) involves the electronic sharing of patient information between different healthcare organizations. By applying ISO/TS 13972, HIEs can ensure that the clinical data they exchange is standardized, interoperable, and secure. This can improve the efficiency of the exchange and increase the value of the data for healthcare providers.

5. Clinical Research: Researchers can apply ISO/TS 13972 to ensure that the clinical data they collect and analyze is accurate, reliable, and can be easily interpreted. This can improve the quality of the research and increase its value for healthcare providers and policymakers.

6. Public Health Surveillance: Public health organizations can apply ISO/TS 13972 to ensure that the clinical data they collect for surveillance purposes is standardized, interoperable, and secure. This can improve the efficiency of the surveillance and increase the value of the data for public health decision-making.
