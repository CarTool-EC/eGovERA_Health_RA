						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Description: The Personal Health Record System Functional Model, Release 1 standard specifies features and functions necessary to create and effectively manage PHRs and that help an individual maintain a longitudinal view of his or her health history. Personal Health Record information is expected to be sent, received, or exchanged from multiple systems, including: Electronic Health Record systems, insurer systems, payer systems, health information exchanges, public health systems, Internet-based health education sites, clinical trials systems, and/or collaborative care systems.

Additional information: The Personal Health Record System Functional Model (PHR-S FM) specification is a comprehensive framework developed by Health Level Seven International (HL7), a global authority on standards for interoperability of health information technology. This model provides a detailed description of the features and functionalities that a personal health record system (PHRS) should possess to ensure effective management and exchange of health information.

The PHR-S FM specification outlines the necessary capabilities of a PHRS, including the ability to capture, manage, and share health information across different healthcare settings and among various stakeholders such as patients, healthcare providers, and caregivers. It covers a wide range of functionalities such as health data management, privacy and security, access control, communication, decision support, and administrative functions.

The model is designed to be flexible and adaptable to accommodate various types of PHRS, including standalone systems, tethered or connected systems, and integrated systems. It also supports interoperability with other health information systems, enabling seamless exchange of health data.

The PHR-S FM specification serves as a guide for developers, implementers, and users of PHRS, helping them understand what features and functionalities to look for or include in a PHRS. It also aids in the evaluation and comparison of different PHRS, promoting standardization and interoperability in the health information technology industry.

The PHR-S FM specification is not a technical standard for how to build a PHRS, but rather a functional model that describes what a PHRS should be able to do. It does not dictate specific technologies, architectures, or design approaches to be used in the development of a PHRS. Instead, it provides a set of functional requirements that a PHRS should meet to effectively support personal health management and care delivery.

Example: 1. Chronic Disease Management: A patient with a chronic disease like diabetes or hypertension can use the PHR-S FM to keep track of their health data over time. They can record their blood sugar or blood pressure readings, medication doses, and any symptoms or side effects they experience. This information can be shared with their healthcare provider to adjust treatment plans as necessary.

2. Post-Surgical Care: After a surgical procedure, a patient can use the PHR-S FM to record their recovery progress. They can note any pain or discomfort, track their wound healing, and record any medications they are taking. This information can be shared with their surgeon or primary care provider to ensure a smooth recovery process.

3. Mental Health Management: A person dealing with mental health issues like depression or anxiety can use the PHR-S FM to track their mood, sleep patterns, and any side effects from medications. They can also record any therapy sessions or mental health exercises they complete. This information can be shared with their mental health provider to monitor progress and adjust treatment plans as needed.

4. Pregnancy and Childbirth: A pregnant woman can use the PHR-S FM to track her prenatal care, including doctor's appointments, ultrasound results, and any symptoms or concerns. After childbirth, the system can be used to record the baby's growth and development, as well as the mother's postpartum recovery. This information can be shared with the obstetrician or pediatrician to ensure the health of both mother and baby.

5. Elderly Care: For elderly individuals, the PHR-S FM can be used to track various health parameters like blood pressure, heart rate, medication schedules, and any symptoms or health concerns. This information can be shared with their healthcare provider or caregiver to ensure they are receiving the appropriate care.

6. Fitness and Wellness: For individuals interested in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, the PHR-S FM can be used to track exercise routines, dietary habits, sleep patterns, and other wellness metrics. This information can be used to monitor progress towards fitness goals and to identify any potential health concerns.
