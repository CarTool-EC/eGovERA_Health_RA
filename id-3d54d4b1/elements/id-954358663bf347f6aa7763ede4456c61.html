Additional information: Each entity in the catalogue acts as a consumer of digital public services in the health sector, meaning they utilize digital platforms and services provided by the public sector for various health-related purposes. For instance, a hospital might use digital services for patient registration and record-keeping, while a health insurance company might use them for policy management and claims processing. The catalogue is comprehensive, covering a wide range of entities from individual health professionals and patients to large institutions and government bodies.

Example: For example, a 'Patient' in this catalogue refers to a healthcare patient when she/he acts as a digital service consumer. A patient is a person receiving or registered to receive medical treatment. They might use digital public services to book appointments, access their medical records, or communicate with healthcare providers. Similarly, a 'Health insurance company' refers to health insurance companies when they act as digital public service consumers. They are financial institutions providing a range of insurance policies to protect individuals and businesses against health risk. They might use digital public services for policy management, claims processing, and other administrative tasks.
